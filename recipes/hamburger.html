    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Juciest Hamburgers Ever from allrecipes</p>
    <p>No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Baste frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat grill for high heat.</li>
